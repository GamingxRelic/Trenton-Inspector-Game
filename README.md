# Trenton-Inspector-Game
A Top Down Driving game created as part of college project for Trentoniana at The Trenton Free Public Library in Trenton, New Jersey.

At the Trentoniana Collection in Trenton, New Jersey, we found a collection of old health inspection records from bars around Trenton from the 1930s and 1940s. We used this information to create a video game where you play as an inspector during the 1940s drive around the city and view the history of various buildings in Trenton. Explore a pixel art city based on Trenton and view the history of 8 different buildings.

This class was created as part of a college project.
