history = "In 1792, Jonathan Doane constructed the New Jersey State House, one of the state's oldest capitols. The structure cost Â£250 and covered 3.75 acres. The Senate and General Assembly occupied the first floor, while the governor's and judicial offices occupied the second. On the roof, there was a bell tower and seven bays.
Many structural and design changes occurred during the 1800s and early 1900s. Following a fire in 1885, a three-story reconstruction with a new rotunda and dome was built. Arnold Moses would eventually rebuild the State House in the Renaissance style."
